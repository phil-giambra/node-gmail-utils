# node-gmail-utils
Work with the gmail API in node js

This app is meant to be a relatively simple means to send & receive Gmail from a Node js program.

The plan is to make this usable as
* a standalone app with a cli interface
* to be called as a sub-process from another app
* and maybe a standalone app with a websocket interface
